Once you have completed the challenge, do **Save Version** one last time, then download the notebook to your local computer. \n2. You have to change the name of the notebook to include the same username from your email that you used to register to this course. A notebook's filename is something like: `<filename>.ipynb`, if your email is `example_username@gmail.com` then your notebook needs be named `example_username@gmail.com.ipynb`. After renaming the file, go upload it to the submission google form. **( failing to comply with this instruction might make an application invalid )**.  \n##  \n  \n______\n\n# Introduction\n\nWelcome! In this notebook you have a few exercises to solve with Python. This notebook shouldn't take you more than 2h to complete, excluding for the last exercise which is a bit harder. But don't worry too much if you have trouble solving it.\n  \nIn all exercises you are supposed to create a function for the task at hand. The structure of each exercise is the following:\n\n1. A block of text describing the exercise objectives\n2. The code cell for you to complete the function, as well as an example prepared for you to check the output of your function for any given input\n\n### How this test will be evaluated\n\n1. You download this notebook and submit it in the submission google form\n2. We will run your notebook and add our own test cases for each function where we will try a few different input examples with expected output results. You will be graded based on how many of our examples your code is able to return the expected result throughout the different exercises\n\n### How to solve each exercise\n\n1. Delete the line raise NotImplementedError() and create your code solution inside the function to return the correct output.\n2. You can test your function by changing the `example_input` in the `\"Example usage:\"` section and try different scenarios.\n\n### Tips and mistakes to avoid\n\n1. In harder exercises your function may return the right output for some examples but fail in edgecase examples. It is your responsibility to account for this and create your own examples and evaluate if you code has the expected behavior for each in order to find bugs in your code.\n2. **Don't change** the function name of each exercise.\n3.

So the characters \"t\" and \"T\" for example, should not be considered the same characters.","metadata":{"deletable":false,"id":"bb318acc","tags":["hide_input"]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"----\n\\[optional\\] **my reasoning:**\n\nFirst a matrix is created with each column corresponding to a char from s2 and each line a char from s1 (there is one additional line and column (the first) that handle empty strings).\nThen, we enter a double for loop that checks if every pair of chars matches. It is important to notice that if the matrix was to have an int for matching characters and a 0 for non matching, we could look at any diagonal from top left to right bottom that consisted only of non-0 to 'find' the substring. So that's what happens, however, said number is the previous int in the 'diognal' + 1. That way, we can, as we iterate to find, also get the length and the position of the longest substring and add it to a string variable. To do so, we take advantage of slicing where whe start at i minus the max lenght that we already know and end in i. We could obviously slice any of the strings the output would be the same.\n---","metadata":{"id":"403c2368"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def longest_common_substring(s1, s2):\n    len1, len2 = len(s1), len(s2)\n\n    char_matrix = [[0] * (len2 + 1) for _ in range(len1 + 1)]\n\n    longest_len = 0\n    longest_substring = ''\n\n    for i in range(1, len1+1):\n        for j in range(1, len2+1):\n            if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n                char_matrix[i][j] = char_matrix[i-1][j-1] + 1\n                if char_matrix[i][j] > longest_len:\n                    longest_len = char_matrix[i][j]\n                    longest_substring = s1[i - longest_len:i]\n            else:\n                char_matrix[i][j] = 0\n    return longest_substring\n\n# Example usage:\ns1 = \"grh\"\ns2 = \"AC rt grh\"\nprint(longest_common_substring(s1, s2))  # Expected Output: \"CDGH\"","metadata":{"id":"2516a37e","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-21T20:32:48.211096Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-21T20:32:48.211535Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-21T20:32:48.245359Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-21T20:32:48.211486Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-21T20:32:48.244596Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"grh\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The End!","metadata":{"id":"ce9cc78f"}}]}
